# ![dynMix](dynmix.png)

This is a Python package for clustering and mixture modelling and was developed as part of my master's dissertation. The objective is to include various routines for dealing with clustering time-series data, including a dynamic clustering option, which is a proposed model from my paper, [available here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01890).       

It is currently in late stages of development but may contain some errors. You may install and use the library through PyPi:
```pip install dynmix```
