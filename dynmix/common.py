    '''
    Returns the problem dimensions given the cannonical arguments.

    Args:
        Y: A matrix with T rows and n*m columns.
        F_list: A list with k specifications for the F matrix of each cluster.
        G_list: A list with k specifications for the G matrix of each cluster.

    Returns:
        k: The number of clusters.
        m: The dimension of a single observation.
        p: List with the dimension of state space for each cluster.
        n: Number of replicates.
        T: Size of time window.
        index_mask: A map from the observation index to the corresponding Y indexes.
